Compilation using Visual Studio 8:

1) build libevent-1.1b as a Static Library after fixing some issues:
  To build libevent you can use the Win32-libevent-1.1b.diff patch or:
	a) You'll have to create the project files, as the ones provided in the project won't work
	b) in the file signal-test.c:
	   atound line 35, it says __func__, change to __FUNCTION__
	c) in the file time-test.c:
	   around line 17, just above #include <time.h> add the line:
	     #include <Winsock2.h>
	   around line 40, it says __func__, change to __FUNCTION__

2) build memcached using the built libevent.lib
	a) open the Win32-Prj\memcached.sln in Visual Studio
	b) make sure you have added the path to your libevent.lib file:
			Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories -> Library files
	c) build the solution.
	
Other platforms such as Cygwin or MinGW have not been tested.
